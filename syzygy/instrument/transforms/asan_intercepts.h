// Declares structures encoding the list of functions that SyzyASAN
// instrumentation intercepts as part of its implementation.
//
// How the intercepts are performed depends on whether the image being
// instrumented is a COFF image or a PE image. In PE images there are two
// mechanisms:
//
// (1) Functions that are imported are redirected by adding new imports and
//     rewriting references. This requires the undecorated name of the function
//     as it is exported, as well as the module to which it belongs.
// (2) Functions that are statically linked into the binary are discovered by
//     their undecorated names, filtered by their contents (to ensure that they
//     have the expected calling convention, as optimization sometimes modify
//     this), and finally redirected to instrumented implementation via
//     reference rewriting.
//
// In COFF files redirection is performed via symbol rewriting. Any references
// to a decorated symbol are replaced with references to the decorated name of
// the equivalent instrumented function. Redirection is applied to both the
// original decorated name (for direct references, and subsequently statically
// linked functions), as well as the '__imp_' prefixed decorated name (which
// results in the creation of an import entry in the final linked image).
