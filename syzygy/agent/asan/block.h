// Describes and declares an ASan block, which is fundamentally a single
// instrumented allocation of memory.
//
// Under ASan instrumentation allocations are instrumented with leading
// (left) and trailing (right) redzones. The left redzone contains a
// BlockHeader, while the right redzone contains a BlockTrailer. Each of
// these contain metadata about the allocation itself. In both cases the
// redzones may be larger than the headers they contain. Visually, a block is
// laid out as follows:
//
//   +------------------+  <-- N>=8 aligned \
//   |      header      |                   |
//   +------------------+                   |- left redzone
//   |  header padding  |                   |  (mod 8 in size)
//   |    (optional)    |                   /
//   +------------------+  <-- N>=8 aligned
//   |       body       |
//   +------------------+
//   | trailer padding  |                   \
//   |    (optional)    |                   |_ right redzone
//   +------------------+                   |
//   |     trailer      |                   /
//   +------------------+  <-- N>=8 aligned
//
// The information contained in the block headers is insufficient to recover
// the block extents. However, sufficiently detailed bookkeeping information is
// maintained in the shadow memory to allow inferring this data given a block
// pointer.
//
// NAVIGATING A BLOCK
//
// If the block is not corrupt it contains sufficient information to navigate
// the various components simply from inspecting the contents of memory itself.
//
// In the absence of any header padding the body immediately follows the
// header, and the length of the body is encoded directly in the header. The
// header has a bit indicating the presence of header padding. If present it
// has a length of at least kShadowRatio[1], and encodes the total length of
// the padding in the first 4 *and* last 4 bytes of the padding. This makes it
// possible to navigate in O(1) time from the body to the header and vice
// versa.
//
// There is always some implicit minimal amount of trailer padding required to
// flesh out the block body such that the end of the trailer is properly
// aligned. Another header bit indicates if there is more than this implicit
// padding present. If so, the trailer padding length is explicitly encoded in
// the first 4 bytes of the trailer padding. Either way it is possible to
// navigate to the beginning of the trailer.
//
// The rest of the header and trailer padding are filled with constant values
// as a visual debugging aid. An example block (with body of size 16, header
// padding of size 16, and trailer padding of 12) is shown in memory:
//
//   | 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0a 0b 0c 0d 0e 0f
// --+------------------------------------------------
