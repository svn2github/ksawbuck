// Declares a class for reading/extracting files from a lib file in the 'ar'
// achive format.
//
// A MSVS library file uses the standard archive file format that is used
// by most toolchains everywhere. More specifically it observes the same format
// as the GNU variant, with seem extensions. The format is well documented here:
//
//   http://kishorekumar.net/pecoff_v8.1.htm
//
// The archive contains three special metadata files, occurring as the three
// files in the archive.
//
//   "/" : This file contains a concatenation of all symbol information
//         across all object files in the library. This is divided into
//         3 parts:
//         - a big-endian 32-bit integer encoding the number of symbols.
//         - big-endian 32-bit integers encoding the offset in the archive
//           of the file containing the symbol. This must be in increasing
//           order.
//         - a concatenation of null-terminated ASCII-encoded symbol
//           names. These are implicitly ordered due to the ordering of the
//           offsets.
//         This table only ends up pointing to object files that actually
//         contain symbols, this can undercount the true number of files in
//         the archive. This is present for backwards compatibility with
//         older linkers (and the GCC format), but is not actively used by
//         MSVS.
//   "/" : If a second file with the name "/" is present this is a MSVS
//         custom table that encodes the number of files in the archive, and
//         their absolute locations.
//         - a little endian 32-bit integer indicating the number of object
//           files in the archive. This includes object files that do not
//           contain symbols.
//         - little-endian 32-bit integers encoding the offset in the archive
//           of the file containing the symbol.
//         - a little-endian 32-bit integer encoding the number of symbols.
//         - a run of little-endian 16-bit integers indicating the file in
//           which the symbol is located (1 indexed).
//         - a concatenation of null-terminated ASCII-encoded symbol
//           names. These are in increasing lexical order.
//   "//": This file contains extended filenames of all object files in the
//         library. These are simply a concatenation of null-terminated
//         ASCII-encoded filenames. This has been observed to always be in
//         the same order as the files in the archive itself.
//         NOTE: This file does not always have the name '//', sometimes
//               appearing as a 3rd '/' table.
//
// All of the above mentioned special files must exist in the archive, and must
// be the first 3 files.
//
// The actual object files are stored with names like "/<some-number>".
// Their true full path names are available at offset <some-number> in the "//"
// extended path name stream. These have been observed to be in strictly
// increasing order, with the filenames themselves in no particular order.
//
// It is worth noting that the file offset table in the "/" file need not be in
// order of increasing offset, although it usually is. If it isn't, then the
// actual order of the files in the archive should be ignored, and the order
// implied by the offset table used when navigating. This is the order that
// reflects the way symbols have been added to the symbol table. This is mostly
// important when reading files from one archive and writing them into another;
// to maintain proper symbol information we must ensure we iterate over the
// files in the order they are specified in the offset table.
